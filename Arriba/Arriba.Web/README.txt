Build Steps
===========
 - Install NPM
 - From Arriba.Web, run "npm install" - it should install all dependencies by reading package.json.
 - Run Build.WebSite.cmd with an optional path to a configuration folder.
   [The configuration folder contains overrides of the configuration in Arriba.Web\jsx\DefaultConfiguration.jsx to customize the site look and feel, and any custom React classes, like custom details views.]
